# Tic Tac Toe Game

I built this Tic Tac Toe game using React. The game features a simple interface where two players can take turns marking Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid. The game keeps track of the players' moves, checks for a winner, and displays the game's status, including whether there is a tie or a winner. I implemented state management to handle the game's logic and used functional components to build the UI. This project helped me solidify my understanding of React hooks and state management.

## Features

- Interactive 3x3 grid for gameplay
- Tracks player moves and alternates between X and O
- Determines the winner or if the game ends in a tie
- Displays game status and move history
