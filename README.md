I deployed this game using Github : https://yazhinib.github.io/TIC-TAC-TOE/

I built this Tic Tac Toe game with the basic building blocks: squares, a board, and a way to track turns (X and O).  Then, I threw in some logic to check for winning conditions and keep the game state in check. To make things smooth, I used React's state management features to update the board and display the current game status.  Finally, I styled it all up with a touch of CSS for a clean and playable experience.

HAPPY GAMING!
